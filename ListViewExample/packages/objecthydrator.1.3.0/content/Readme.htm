            Object Hydrator</p>
        <p>
            Version 0.6<br />
            10/28/2009</p>
        <p>
            Introduction:<br />
            Object Hydrator is a tool to ease the &quot;Model First&quot; development style and 
            testing scenarios, by generating objects with pre-filled data.&nbsp; Doing so 
            allows you the freedom of working in your application with &#39;realistic&#39; data at 
            the same time giving you the flexibility to make changes to your model on the 
            fly.</p>
        <p>
            Using convention over configuration, Object Hydrator will pick an appropriate 
            data type based on the type in the model and/or the name of the property and 
            generate the data for you automatically.&nbsp; With a fluent interface you can 
            override these conventions easily and smoothly.</p>
        <p>
            A very simple example is as follows:<br />
            Given this class</p>
        <p>
            public class Customer<br />
            {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public string FirstName {get;set;}<br />
            }<br />
            <br />
            You can populate an instance of this class with a random real-world first name 
            by first creating an instance of the Hydrator like so...<br />
            <br />
            Hydrator&lt;Customer&gt; hydrator=new Hydrator&lt;Customer&gt;();<br />
            <br />
            And then call the GetSingle method assigning it to a new customer object like 
            this....<br />
            <br />
            Customer mynewcustomer=hydrator.GetSingle();</p>
        <p>
            You can also inject your own generators at instantiation time, as long as the implement the IGenerator interface. See Hydrator_InjectedGenerator_Test.cs
        </p>
        <p>
            For more detailed examples please see the unit tests in 
            Hydrator_SimpleCustomerTests.cs or the SampleWebApplication</p>
